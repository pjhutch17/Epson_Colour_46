   For each character from character 160 to character 255, there is
   an entry in this table, which is used to print (or simulate printing of)
   the full Amiga character set. (see AmigaDos Developer's Manual, pp A-3)
   This table is used only if there is a valid pointer to this table
   in the PEDData table in the printertag.asm file, and the VERSION is
   33 or greater.  Otherwise, a default table is used instead.
   To place non-printable characters in this table, you can either enter
   them as in C strings (ie \011, where 011 is an octal number, or as
   \\000 where 000 is any decimal number, from 1 to 3 digits.  This is
   usually used  to enter a NUL into the array (C has problems with it
   otherwise.), or if you forgot your octal calculator.  On retrospect,
   was a poor choice for this function, as you must say \\\\ to enter a
   backslash as a backslash.  Live and learn...
